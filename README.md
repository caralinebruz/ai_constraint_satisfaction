Output

By default this code will write all parts of the outputs to data/out directory in the following formats:

all outputs will go to data/out regardless of inputfilepath (relative as well as absolute input file paths will write to data/out)

EG. if the inputfile is tiny.txt, then all CNF outputs go to data/out/cnf_tiny.txt_out
